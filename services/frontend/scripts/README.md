# Scripts

Just like the rest of the repo, these are just some useful utility scripts for the Frontend.

```
├── cypress_run_parallel_single.mjs     # Main (cross-platform) script for the parallel Cypress process; runs a single instance.
├── cypress_run_parallel_single.sh      # Original (bash) script for the parallel Cypress process; runs a single instance.
├── run.sh                              # Main script used by the Frontend Docker image for running either dev or prod.
└── split_spec_files.js                 # Helper script for the parallel Cypress process; performs the splitting on the test suite files.
```
