 *  So with the 'middle' alignment, the bar is centered over the data point.
 *  Whereas with the 'start' alignment, the left side of the bar starts at the data point.
 *
 *  The reason we need to calculate the bar alignment is because, for some _stupid_ reason,
 *  when we're using the weekly range size (i.e. there are few bars), the alignment of the bars
 *  relative to the x-axis labels is _way_ off. To the point where we need the 'start' alignment
 *  to get the bars visually centered over the labels. Every other range size is fine.
 *
 *  Note that using the 'start' alignment has the negative side-effect of causing the tooltips to no
 *  longer be centered over the bars, but I couldn't find a way to fix this properly (x offsets and whatnot
 *  weren't good enough considering the bar width is dynamic), so we're taking that as tradeoff vs
 *  not having the bars centered over the labels (which looks _much_ worse, IMO). */
