/*  Why this file exists:
 *
 *      In the general case, managing async requests usually requires at least
 *      3 states: 'request started', 'request succeeded', and 'request failed'.
 *      'clear' is used to reset the state back to its default values for situations
 *      other than 'request succeeded' eg. 'request cancelled'.
 *
 *      In terms of actual data, these 3 states usually mean that a 'loading' variable
 *      and an 'error' variable need to be stored somewhere for the UI to react to.
 *      This 'state' is either usually stored in Redux or in local React component state.
 *
 *      Since we want to be able to model the high-level state all in Redux land
 *      (so that it is independent of the view layer), then we need to specifically
 *      manage 'request state' in Redux.
 *
 *      Following from this, it makes sense that since we'll likely have many requests,
 *      we'll need a common pattern to encapsulate the async request flow, otherwise
 *      there'll be a hundred and one slightly different implementations of how to call the API.
 *
 *      To that end, this file has a 'request slice' factory takes in a 'requestType' string
 *      and creates a set of actions, reducers, and selectors that are all consistently
 *      named based on that 'requestType' string.
 *
 *      However, we also need to manage the transitions between each of the request's states.
 *      This is what the 'request saga' is for: it delegates the actual request logic
 *      to another saga that can be bound after the creation of the 'request slice', but it augments
 *      the request logic with handling of the 'success' and 'failed' states. This way, the
 *      actual request logic is kept as simple as possible, and code duplication is minimized.
 *
 *      As such, only the `request` action is ever dispatched by the 'end user'
 *      (i.e. a React component).
