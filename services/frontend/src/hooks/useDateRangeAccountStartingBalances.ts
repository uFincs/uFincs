/** Calculates the starting balances (i.e. the 'starting' balance and the 'from' balance)
 *  for a single account.
 *
 *  The 'starting' balance is the balance used at the start of calculating an account's balance
 *  over a certain date range.
 *
 *  The 'from' balance is the balance right before a certain date range. It is used as the 'From'
 *  amount when calculating the change in an account's balance between two periods.
 *
 *  For assets and liabilities, the 'starting' and 'from' balances are the same (since they
 *  have accumulative balances).
 *
 *  However, for income and expense accounts, since their balances are _not_ accumulative,
 *  their 'starting' balance is always 0, whereas their 'from' balance is the sum of all
 *  their transactions in the previous date range. */
